      <h2>Coding Newb, Business Oriented, and Casual Sports Fan</h2>
    
  <p> I am originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I have lived in three states. This is my second time in college. The first time was at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities about seven years ago.
    I am twenty seven years young. I love the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Chargers. My crush is Daenerys Targaryen in the Game of Thrones. This is my second coding class and am eager to keep learning more. </p>
